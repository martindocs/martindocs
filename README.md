## 👋 Hi, I’m Marcin

I'm a self-driven developer interested in practical coding, building tools that solve real problems, automate tasks, and support everyday work.

This GitHub profile is where I keep track of personal projects, learning progress, and internal tools I build (when I can).

---

### 🧠 Current Focus

- **C#** – My main learning goal. I'm building small apps and exploring what I can do with desktop, web, console apps.  
  
- **JavaScript** – The language I've worked with the longest. Currently using it for internal web-based tooling at work (HTML/CSS/JavaScript).

- **Python** – Mostly using for automation (scripting boring or repetitive tasks).

---

### 🛠 Tools & Skills

- **Languages:** JavaScript, C# (learning), Python (automation)
- **Web:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), Bootstrap
- **Desktop:** WPF, Microsoft Office/SolidWorks add-ins
- **Backend:** ASP.NET (learning), Node.js
- **Databases:** Some basic SQL knowledge (still learning)
- **Tools:** Git, Postman, REST APIs, Visual Studio, VS Code

### 🔍 Why I'm Here

I just like to code, keep learning, and document my progress.  
This profile helps me stay organized and reflect on how far I've come.
