# Hello, I'm Marcin

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about crafting elegant solutions to complex problems. Here, you'll find a showcase of my key projects, organized by theme, and a glimpse into my journey of continuous learning and exploration.

## 🚀 Current Project: C# Mini Projects

Welcome to the CSharp Playground repository! This space is dedicated to exploring C# through theory, code snippets, and mini projects. The goal of this repository is to be an ever-evolving collection of resources as I dive deeper into C# concepts and build out small programs for practice.

- **Technologies Used:** 🛠️ C#, .NET, WPF, ASP.NET (with plans to incorporate more libraries and frameworks as I progress).
- **Learning:** Currently focusing on foundational C# skills, with plans to delve into advanced topics such as asynchronous programming, design patterns, and more.
- **Collaboration:** If you're interested in contributing, feel free to reach out!

Project Goals:
- Build console applications to solidify basic C# concepts.
- Develop desktop applications using WPF to explore UI design and data binding.
- Create web applications with ASP.NET to understand MVC architecture and backend development.
- Experiment with game development using Unity and C# scripting.
- Learn database management with Entity Framework and SQL Server, including CRUD operations and data modeling.
- Implement design patterns like MVVM and repository pattern in real-world scenarios.
- Explore asynchronous programming and parallelism for improved performance in applications.
- Develop RESTful APIs and integrate them with frontend applications.
