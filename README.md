## 👋 Hi, I’m Marcin

I'm a self-driven developer interested in practical coding, building tools that solve real problems, automate tasks, and support everyday work.

This GitHub profile is where I keep track of personal projects, learning progress, and internal tools I build (when I can).

---

### 🧠 Current Focus

- **C#** – My main learning goal. I'm building small apps and exploring what I can do with desktop, web, console apps, and Office/SolidWorks add-ins.  
  Due to IT restrictions at work, I mostly build C# tools for myself — but I'm committed to growing in this area for future backend or internal tool development.

- **JavaScript** – The language I've worked with the longest. Currently using it for internal web-based tooling at work (HTML/CSS/JavaScript — no backend), since it's easier to deploy without IT involvement.

- **Python** – Mostly using for automation (scripting boring or repetitive tasks). I'm still learning and getting more comfortable writing standalone scripts from scratch.

### 🛠 Tools & Skills

- **Languages:** JavaScript, C# (learning), Python (automation)
- **Web:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), Bootstrap
